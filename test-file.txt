Professional, Efficient Web Developer

I have 8 years experience in Software Development. I have graduated the University in 2007
(Computer Science Department 2003-2007). I was a team member in the ACM (http://www.acm.org)
programming contest of my University. I like Software Architectures, Design Paterns, 
and Algorithms. In 2008 I have graduated the Master Class in Databases ane ECommerce.

As work experience, I can mention:
 - 2006 - 2008 junior developer at Softvision http://softvision.com/: .NET, ASP, MSSQL Server. 
 My responsabilities were to implement the codding specifications.
 - 2008 - 2010 senior developer at Softvision, .NET, ASP, MSSQL Server. My responsabilities 
 were to design the software architecture, to breakdown the project into small tasks, to estimate
 the implementation time for each task, to implement them, and ro send a daily status to the client.
 - 2011 - now: Manager at Priscilla Consulting. This is my own company, so I have many 
 responsabilities, such as: discussions with the clients, analyze the client needs, propose
 a solution, design the solution in a technical way, implement & test the solution. 
 
I am new on Elance, so I am able to present only projects from my portofolio, 
not projects implemented on Elance. You can see a list of developed projects at:
http://www.priscilla-consulting.com/proiecte/portofoliu, but there are many project which
I was unable to publish on my site. I have integrated electronic coin API's such as: 
Perfect Money, Liberty Reserve, CashU, OkPay, MTGox Bitcoin. I have worked with SOAP services,
CURL library, XML, image processing, custom MySQL queries, sql query performance improvments,
etc. The online exchange project produces the more electrifying results for me.

github repository:

https://github.com/priscillaconsulting/test-project

suggest a platform and rationale for it:
------------------------------------------------------
I suggest CodeIgniter as the development platform. It is a MVC framework and it is Object Oriented.
I am very familiar with it, so I will be very productive in this environment.
There are a lot of good documentation, it is well structured, into three main concepts: 
  - models: php classes, used in order to manage tabase data
  - views: html or php files, used in order to display data
  - controllers: php classes, used in order implement the business logic of the application.
There are auxiliary concepts such as:
  - helpers: files where are defined plain php functions, in a procedural way
  - libraries: php classes which can be used in many way, for instance as wrappers over external APIs, etc
  - hooks, configs, third party classes, etc
  
Ask any questions you may have!

I am very curious to see the project "big picture" and project tasks.
